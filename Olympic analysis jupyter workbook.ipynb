The data, spanning from the 2000 to 2023 Olympic Games, will include medal counts and GDP figures. The ETL process will transform raw CSV files into fact and dimension tables, which will be organized in a data warehouse using PGAdmin. Atoti will be used for visualizations to answer these key questions.\n",
